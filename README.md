# Daniel Ames' Personal Website

 _I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all._

## About

My name is Daniel Ames. I created this website primarily to serve as a personal notetaking archive.

## Plans

I plan to post weekly, beginning in January of 2025. To begin, I will mostly be arranging and polishing existing notes of mine on statistical and mathematical concepts.
