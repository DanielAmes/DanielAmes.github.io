I created this blog primarily to serve as a personal notetaking archive, but at the same time I hope to one day make it a house of many mansions, peopled by representatives of all the regions of my mind.

## Plans

I plan to post weekly, beginning in January of 2025. To begin, I will mostly be arranging and polishing existing notes of mine.
