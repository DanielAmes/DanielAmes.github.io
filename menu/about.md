I created this blog primarily to serve as a personal notetaking archive, but at the same time I hope to one day make it a house of many mansions, peopled by representatives of all the regions of my mind.

## Plans

I plan to post weekly, beginning in 2025.

## Principles

If there is any guiding philosphy behind my posts, it is that one cannot thoroughly understand a mathematical or statistical concept until one has reconstructed it from the foundation up, and indeed I believe that this kind of foundational understanding makes possible and therefore must necessarily precede the sensible application of the concept to practical problems.
