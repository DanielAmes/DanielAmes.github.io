My name is Daniel Ames. I created this blog primarily to serve as a personal notetaking archive, but at the same time I hope to one day people it with representatives from all the regions of my mind.

## Plans

I plan to make a few posts each month, beginning in January of 2025. To begin, I will mostly be arranging and polishing existing notes of mine on statistical and mathematical concepts.
