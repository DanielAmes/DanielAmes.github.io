I created this blog primarily to serve as a personal notetaking archive, but at the same time I hope it will one day become a house of many mansions, peopled by representatives of all the regions of my mind.

## Plans

I would like to make a habit of posting weekly.

## Principles

If there is any guiding philosphy behind the structure of my posts, it is that one cannot thoroughly understood a mathematical or statistical concept until one has reconstructed it from the foundation up, and indeed I believe that this kind of foundational understanding makes possible and therefore must necessarily precede the sensible application of the concept to practical problems. 

Note that the foundation-building that I refer to is not based upon mathematical formalisms such as measure theory. I speak merely of the synthesis of simple ideas into complex ones, which can be accomplished in the absence of strict formalism.
