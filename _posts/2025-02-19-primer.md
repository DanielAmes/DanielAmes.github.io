_salimmo sù, el primo e io secondo,_

_tanto ch’i’ vidi de le cose belle_

_che porta ’l ciel..._

-Inferno, Canto XXXIV


In grade school, many of us were introduced to the rudiments of astronomy; we learned that the earth and seven other planets orbit the sun, that the moon likewise orbits the earth; we were made to memorize the phases of the moon, the order of the planets, etc. But as homely as these bare facts may appear, many of them are in reality quite theoretical, in the sense that they are divorced from our daily experience of the heavens.  To our detriment, we received little grounding in the relations that hold between the celestial phenomena that we perceive when we direct our eyes skyward and this precious little cache of abstract knowledge.

# Notes

For the title, I borrowed a phrase from the quaint language of 18th century science found in Laplace's _Exposition du système du monde_, a wonderful work whose first chapter covers much of the same material as I do in this post.
