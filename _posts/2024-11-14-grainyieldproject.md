## Background
On the scale of a single plant, it is well known that the application of mineral fertilizers improves plant growth but that beyond a certain point of fertilizer saturation in the soil, a marginal increase in fertilizer will no longer produce a merginal increase in plant growth; thus, in an experiment where the amount of fertilizer applied is varied, we expect the curve of plant growth as a function of fertilizer to be monotonic increasing but also to exhibit an asymptote. An example of what this looks like for phosphorus fertilizer can be seen below (adapted from Alley and Vanlauwe, 2009).

I wanted to know whether the same effect is visible on a global scale, where each country's grain yield for a given year represents a single data point or whether, to the contrary, other determinants of yield overshadow the effect of fertilizer.



We begin by considering the yield and fertilizer data from a single year, 2020, because that is the most recent year for which complete data is available.
